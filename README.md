# Code Catalog Application Overview

This project was created alongside two other talented classmates Triston Yontz and Bismark Akomeah as our final capstone project during our time at Tech Elevator in Columbus, Ohio.

This project is a robust and user-friendly full-stack web application utilizing Vue.js for a dynamic UI, .NET Core MVC
framework, and SQL database for a structured back-end. The application offers a comprehensive platform for managing code snippets in a
variety of programming languages. Users can view predefined code snippets curated by the website administrator
and create their own personalized code snippet examples that are saved and viewable in their own user page.
